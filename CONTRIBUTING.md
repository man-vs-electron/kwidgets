# Versioning

DataPanels uses a form of the standard Semantic Versioning methodology 
(https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for naming versions.  All versions 
will take the form X.Y.Z.  All X.*.* versions will maintain backward 
compatibility starting with 1.0.0.  An increment in a MINOR (Y) version 
indicates new functionality. An increment in a PATCH (Z) version 
indicates a bug fix.  PATCHES may also contain simple changes like 
exposing options that were hard coded before.  Development versions 
(X.Y.Z.devD) may be released as well. These versions may be tagged on 
branches that are eventually collapsed when merged back into master.  
All X.Y.Z versions will be found on master.
